linear:
1) add Cdiff environment to this codebase
2) add data generation code to here (synthetic dataset)

observed issues:
1) once entropy drops, it can not get back because of the expectation in loss function
   => low entropy sucks
2) too high entropy is again not good as it forces data loss to not work
   => high entropy sucks
3) the switch network should be very not powerful, all power should be given to 
   weight network (more lines to draw with enough entropy in in switch network)
4) independent weight network needs much different learning rate!

relevant experiment: triangle_2hidden, triangle_small
a challenging dataset: square2*

todos:
1. change order of save from method/data to data/method
2. refactor setLogName and others to use proper Object Oriented style
