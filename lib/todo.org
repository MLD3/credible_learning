linear:
1) add Cdiff environment to this codebase
2) add data generation code to here (synthetic dataset)

nonlinear:
1) check nan on data loss 
2) calculate the wanted entropy H(y,z), e.g., for binary problem with 3 classifiers
   should have log 6 = 1.8 bits ideally, set a lower bound of some sort
3) add in early stopping
